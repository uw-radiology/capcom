Description:

* CAPTCHAs are used as a method to prevent bots from accessing certain things on the web. They are also used to train ML algorithms.
* Grab images using the DICOMweb API and display them using something like [Cornerstone JS](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone) to display the image.
* Overlay a CAPTCHA-like clickable grid on top of the image.
* Instruct user to click every grid that has something that looks irregular.
* Allow user to then hit 'submit' and proceed to the restricted area of a website.
